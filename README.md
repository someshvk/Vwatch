## About this project
<p>
  Vwatch is a Video Player that plays your favourite YouTube video in a <i>synchronized</i> way i.e. different users can join a particular event/room and everyone sees a particular video and the controls made by one user are reflected in everyones player in that room ( Sort of like a <i>virtual theater</i> ).
